		<h1>Teddy &ndash; Commands reference</h1>
		
		<p>The scripting language of teddy is tcl. Some commands have been disabled, some commands have a different meaning and quite a few commands have been added for buffer manipulation. In addition unknown commands are interpreted "shell like" as external commands, for those commands shell-style auto-globbing is performed and the resulting command line is executed in background.
		
		<h2>Tcl Commands that are disabled</h2>
		<tt>after</tt>, <tt>cd</tt>, <tt>tcl_endOfWord</tt>, <tt>tcl_findLibrary</tt>, <tt>tcl_startOfPreviousWord</tt>, <tt>tcl_wordBreakAfter</tt>, <tt>tcl_wordBreakBefore</tt>.
