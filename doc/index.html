		<h1>Teddy &ndash; introduction</h1>
		<p>Teddy is a tiled text editor inspired by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_%28text_editor%29">Acme</a> text editor but more configurable and more keyboard friendly.

		<p>In addition to editing files you can execute external commands and see their output from inside the editor.

		<p>Teddy supports a scripting language to write editing macros, TAGS files produced by the command ctags, syntax highlighting and autocompletion.

		<h2>Fundamental concepts</h2>

		<h3>Frames</h3>

		<p>Each teddy window is divided into one or more columns, each column is divided into one or more editing frames. Editing frames (in short "frames") either show the editable contents of a file, the output of a command or the contents of a directory.

		<p>The top line contains the current directory and the "Tools" menu. When &lt;Esc&gt; is pressed the top line is replaced with a command line, typing a command here and pressing enter will execute it.

		<p>You can create a new column by choosing the menu item "New column" from the "Tools" menu. New frames are created as needed when opening files, directories or executing commands. To open a file or a directory specifying its full path press &lt;Esc&gt: key then type <tt>buffer open <i>path-to-file</i></tt>, by picking "Search file" from "Tools" menu you can search for a file recursively.

		<h3>Elements of a frame</h3>

		<p>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Resize Handle</b>: When dragged with the mouse will resize the frame (and the column containing the frame). Its color also shows if the currently edited buffer was modified after the last save or not. When it's white (like in the image) the buffer was not modified, when it's blue the buffer was modified and needs to be saved.

		<li><b>Tag</b>: Shows the name of the current buffer. Some <a href="mouse.html#tag">mouse operations</a> are available on this GUI element.

		<li><b>Editing Area</b>: Lets the user edit the buffer associated with this frame.
		<li><b>Position Box</b>: Shows the current position of the cursor in the editing area, both as absolute position (line number, glyph number) and as percentage of the complete file.
		</ul>

		<h2>Output buffers and links</h2>

		<p><center><img src="teddy_link.png"></center>

		<p>By pressing &lt;Esc&gt;, typing an external command (for example <tt>make</tt>) and pressing &gt;Enter&lt; the external command will be executed and its output displayed on an output frame. When teddy finds names of files in the output of an external command it will transform them into hyperlinks.

		In the example, clicking "editor.c:17:18" will open the file <tt>editor.c</tt> (or focus its frame if it's already open) and go to the 18th column of the 17th line.

		<h2>Default keybindings</h2>

		When teddy is first started a configuration file is created in <tt>$HOME/.config/teddy/rc</tt>. You are encouraged to read that file.

		<h2>Interaction</h2>

		There are three ways to interact with teddy:
