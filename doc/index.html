		<h1>Teddy &ndash; introduction</h1>
		<p>Teddy is a tiled text editor inspired by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_%28text_editor%29">Acme</a> text editor but more configurable and more keyboard friendly.

		<p>In addition to editing files you can execute external commands and see their output from inside the editor.

		<p>Teddy supports a scripting language to write editing macros, TAGS files produced by the command ctags, syntax highlighting and autocompletion.

		<h2>Fundamental concepts</h2>

		<h3>Frames</h3>

		<p>Each teddy window is divided into one or more columns, each column is divided into one or more editing frames. Editing frames (in short "frames") either show the editable contents of a file, the output of a command or the contents of a directory.

		<p>The top line contains the command line. Pressing enter when the cursor is on the command line will execute its contents, any command available on the shell will work along with some teddy specific commands.<br>
		The command line can be focused by pressing &lt;Esc&gt;.

		<p>The top line also contains a tools menu, it can be opened by clicking the gear icon.

		<h3>Elements of a frame</h3>

		<p>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Resize Handle</b>: When dragged with the mouse will resize the frame (and the column containing the frame). Its color also shows if the currently edited buffer was modified after the last save or not. When it's white (like in the image) the buffer was not modified, when it's blue the buffer was modified and needs to be saved.

		<li><b>Tag</b>: Shows the name of the current buffer. Some <a href="mouse.html#tag">mouse operations</a> are available on this GUI element.

		<li><b>Editing Area</b>: Lets the user edit the buffer associated with this frame.
		<li><b>Position Box</b>: Shows the current position of the cursor in the editing area, both as absolute position (line number, glyph number) and as percentage of the complete file.
		<li><b>Windows Buttons</b>: each frame also has two icons, the X closes it, the other icon maximizes it.

		</ul>

		<h2>Output buffers and links</h2>

		<p><center><img src="teddy_link.png"></center>

		<p>By pressing &lt;Esc&gt;, typing an external command (for example <tt>make</tt>) and pressing &lt;Enter&gt; the external command will be executed and its output displayed on an output frame. When teddy finds names of files in the output of an external command it will transform them into hyperlinks.

		In the example, clicking "editor.c:17:22" will open the file <tt>editor.c</tt> (or focus its frame if it's already open) and go to the 22nd column of the 17th line.

		<h2>Default keybindings</h2>

		When teddy is first started a configuration file is created in <tt>$HOME/.config/teddy/rc</tt>. You are encouraged to read that file.

		<h2>Interaction</h2>

		There are three ways to interact with teddy:
