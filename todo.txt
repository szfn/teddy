- BUG: cursor on the last character of a link is not a hand
- setting to remove underline from links
- possible code sharing between columns and column?
- test other charsets (like japanese)

- lines -> ropes for internal representation
- bold matched text in autocompletions window and iopen window
- EDITOR and VISUAL setting (needs some IPC implementation)
- multiprocess highlighting
- tabs
- macro recording
