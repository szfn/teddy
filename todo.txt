- Implement rgbcolor tcl command to make easier to set colors in configuration
- implement send to stdin command ('<')
- move builtin commands code from example.teddy into a tcl file and change Makefile and interp.c so it's compiled in and loaded automatically
- Ctrl-o move to next editor (keep a stack of editors like windows' windows)
- command to change buffer font to fixed width (start +bg buffers on fixed width by default)
- ansi sequences processing
- clear buffer command
- command to indent selection/everything by fixed number of spaces/tabs
- implement | command that filters selected content through external command
- make easy way to reindent
- double click -> select word (and movement will also select words)
- triple click -> select lines (and movement will also select lines)
- right click -> search/open file (special algorithm implemented in tcl to match an area to open/search)
- scrolling during mouse selection must be made slower (possibly hook into the cursor redraw timer?)
- appending to a buffer that was never displayed doesn't work (for some reason), tons of valgrind exceptions are generated. There is a valid use case for starting commands on an invisible buffer
- find a way to implement emacs's ctrl-k
- up/down arrows move through history
- persistence of history
- command to reload buffer contents from disk
- auto-reloading buffers when there is no change and the file on disk was changed
- note: left button click does search/open, middle click does primary paste
- tabs
- smart search: search for exact case match only if there is at least one upcase letter in the input
- highlighting
- left+middle -> cut
- configurability
  - enable/disable soft line wrap
- reimplement hbox/vbox to not be broken on resize
  - column_adjust_size just takes the last row and uses all the empty space or 40% if there isn't any empty space
  - put the columns_hbox insite a single custom container that returns a requested size of { 0, 0 } and on allocation just resizes everything maintaining proportions
- highlighting of matching parenthesis

- word selection for open action is longest sequence around point consisting of:
  - letters
  - numbers
  - [-_/.(),:[]]
- open action will first run a tcl implemented parser

- tcl commands to disable:
  - unknown <- if it's a command in the path execute it as if it was specified in exec (but also expand all the words containing a * or a ?)
  
- tcl commands to add:
  - kill -> kill's current process (if one is active in the buffer), otherwise kills current buffer. If an argument is specified does the same thing as the kill command
