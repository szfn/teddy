- rotate history (it slows down startup)

- eval command relative to buffer's base directory (like it was always prefixed with 'in')
 - change interp_eval_command to use buffer_directory
 - change pwd to return buffer->wd when not null, otherwise process filename
 - remove teddy_intl::file_directory

- bold matched text in autocompletions window and iopen window
- EDITOR and VISUAL setting (needs some IPC implementation)
- tabs
- macro recording
