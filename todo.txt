- history on commandline (separate history for searches)

- double click -> select word (and movement will also select words)
- triple click -> select lines (and movement will also select lines)
- right click -> search/open file
- command to reload buffer contents from disk
- auto-reloading buffers when there is no change and the file on disk was changed
- note: left button click does search/open, middle click does primary paste
- tabs
- smart search: search for exact case match only if there is at least one upcase letter in the input
- highlighting
- left+middle -> cut
- configurability
  - enable/disable soft line wrap
- reimplement hbox/vbox to not be broken on resize
  - column_adjust_size just takes the last row and uses all the empty space or 40% if there isn't any empty space
  - put the columns_hbox insite a single custom container that returns a requested size of { 0, 0 } and on allocation just resizes everything maintaining proportions
- highlighting della parentesi associata

- go command improvements:
  - a ':' at the end of the 'go' argument should be always ignored
  - '(' and ')' should be treated as '[' and ']'
  - line number and column can also be separated by ','

- word selection is longest sequence around point consisting of:
  - letters
  - numbers
  - [-_/.]
  - if has at least one / treat as filename
  - if after the end a colon is found treat as filename
  - stuff after filename is optionally enclosed in [] and separed by either ":" or "," at most two numbers

- tcl commands to disable:
  - unknown <- if it's a command in the path execute it as if it was specified in exec (but also expand all the words containing a * or a ?)
  
- tcl commands to add:
  - kill -> kill's current process (if one is active in the buffer), otherwise kills current buffer. If an argument is specified does the same thing as the kill command
