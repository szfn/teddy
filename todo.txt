- auto-equalize indentation on paste
- ability to persist the status of a window
- set column number for background processes whenever possible
- tabs
- macro recording
- make lexy a flat table, lexyassoc just gives the starting state but we can move to other states (implement mixed html / javascript mode)
- multiprocess highlighting

- document:
 s, c, m, ss, regexp, regsub, new buffer subcommands, tags

- BUG: changing font after intialization results in trash (stuff in glyph_info isn't reloaded)
