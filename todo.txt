LONG TERM:
- go refactoring part 1
 - remove bufman command
 - buffer open command
 - buffer select-mode command
 - remove mark command
 - remove go command
 - check builtin and example.teddy for uses of go
 - editor_complete_move becomes private (most editor_ functions should be private)


- implement common awk idioms (like line numbering) with s and m

- replace tcl regex engine with TRE

- autoreload stuff when changed on disk (buffers, tags info)
- remove complex directory visualization (and graphic builtin font)

- set column number for background processes whenever possible
- less ugly indicators for autowrapping
- keyboard marking should behave like mouse marking and not constantly update the clipboard with serialized data
- tabs (and no hidden buffers)
- slash all special mouse actions, add menus and close buttons
- go-able things become links
- save, refresh becomes a subcommand of buffer
- automatically pop-up autocompletion and update autocompletions when leaving dirty rows (enter should not autocomplete, at least on the command line)
- guessing indentation (dtrt-indent mode1)
- auto-equalize indentation on paste
- multiprocess highlighting
- sloppy focus (change focus only when the mouse moves to a different frame) and disable warping
- macro recording
- resize should work across multiple frames
- some commands should be displayed on the working directory line (last command, two most used commands)

- comment region command
- ability to persist the status of a window
- auto-reloading buffers when there is no change and the file on disk was changed
- debugger integration (just displaying currently executed line)
- selection should copy selected text on past not on selection, for better efficiency (selection slowdown is noticeable on mouse selection)
- extend regular expressions in 's' to be lexically aware
- word movement, word selection and tokenization should be tied to syntax analysis
- make easy way to reindent though external filter
- 's' command: support normal pcre flags
- use an editor for the command line
- delete '+' buffers on hide

- cleanup of unused functions (how?)
