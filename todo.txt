- undo (without redo)

- multiple columns
- ability to resize columns
- heuristics to autocreate new frames (and size them)
- drag and drop to rearrange frames

- when two editors show the same buffer the cursor gets repositioned on the first line if you try to scroll only one buffer (remove the constraint that the buffer should be repositioned if it has been scrolled outside the window?)

- Ctrl-backspace to remove one word
- click on file name (inside tag) shows full path
- recalculation optimization (origin point is applyed through cairo with a translation matrix, call to buffer_line_adjust_glyphs is removed and buffer_adjust_glyphs is implemented that only readjusts lines that changed (this function is called once at the start of expose event)
- scripting (for keybindings)
- highlighting
- reminder: use menu key to highlight command line
- note: left button click does search/open, middle click does primary paste
- left+middle -> cut
- double click -> select word (and movement will also select words)
- triple click -> select lines (and movement will also select lines)
- modify origin repositioning to show cursor so that the cursor is put in the middle of the window
- autocompletion for file opening
- history for prompts
- investigate sam's command language
- mouse scrollwheel

- tcl commands to disable:
  - pwd <- return working directory for current buffer
  - unknown <- if it's a command in the path execute it as if it was specified in exec (but also expand all the words containing a * or a ?)
  
- tcl commands to add:
  - putm -> write into a message box
  - pwf -> return current buffer's file
  - kill -> kill's current process (if one is active in the buffer), otherwise kills current buffer. If an argument is specified does the same thing as the kill command
