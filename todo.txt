- "cd" command, "in" command
- setcfg with -global option
- buffer search/creation should not ask where to create it (always new window)

- set column number for background processes whenever possible
- less ugly indicators for autowrapping


LONG TERM:
- keyboard marking should behave like mouse marking and not constantly update the clipboard with serialized data
- tabs (and no hidden buffers)
- project indexing and searching (with tag files support)
- new locate window should start with the text in the clipboard selected if it looks like something good (single word, filename or url)
- remove complex directory visualization (and graphic builtin font)
- slash all special mouse actions, add menus and close buttons
- go-able things become links
- automatically pop-up autocompletion and update autocompletions when leaving dirty rows (enter should not autocomplete, at least on the command line)
- autoreload stuff when changed on disk
- transparent overlay for searching and replacing
- guessing indentation (dtrt-indent mode1)
- auto-equalize indentation on paste
- multiprocess highlighting
- sloppy focus (change focus only when the mouse moves to a different frame) and disable warping
- macro recording

- comment region command
- ability to persist the status of a window
- auto-reloading buffers when there is no change and the file on disk was changed
- replace tcl regex engine with TRE
- debugger integration (just displaying currently executed line)
- selection should copy selected text on past not on selection, for better efficiency (selection slowdown is noticeable on mouse selection)
- extend regular expressions in 's' to be lexically aware
- word movement, word selection and tokenization should be tied to syntax analysis
- make easy way to reindent though external filter
- 's' command: support normal pcre flags
- use an editor for the command line
