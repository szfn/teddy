- BUG: minimized frames sometimes get stuck
- columns should resist changing size (ie the box should be dragged a bit more before they start resizing)

- bold matched text in autocompletions window and iopen window
- EDITOR and VISUAL setting (needs some IPC implementation)
- multiprocess highlighting
- tabs
- macro recording
