- implement go command (moves inside buffers and opens files)
  - line / column moves
  - file open
  - buffer switching when file is already open
  - if file doesn't exist ask if user wants to create it before doing it
- remove ctrl-o keybinding (go command replaces it)

- when buffer manager needs to swap a buffer in asks to select (new frame, current frame, sleect frame) like the 'go' command

- scripting for keybindings

- heuristics to autocreate new frames (and size them)
  - if it was invoked with a buffer that isn't the '+null+' buffer search for an editor containing the '+null+' buffer and if it exists use it (start the search at the right column if the buffer we are trying to open starts with '+' or at the left column otherwise)
  - search for a column with some empty space, start at the right if the buffer we are trying to open starts wit '+', at the left otherwise
  - if none is found try to open a new column
  - if a new column can not be opened try to add a row to the "active" column (the one subjected to the last editing action)
  - if that fails try to open a row starting with the first column and continue until one is found
  - if even this doesn't succeed just replace the current editor with the buffer (or give up if the currrent buffer is '+null+')

- Ctrl-backspace to remove one word
- Ctrl-end to go to end of buffer
- click on file name (inside tag) shows full path
- auto-indent
- highlighting
- reminder: use menu key to highlight command line
- note: left button click does search/open, middle click does primary paste
- left+middle -> cut
- middle click -> paste
- double click -> select word (and movement will also select words)
- triple click -> select lines (and movement will also select lines)
- right click -> search/open file
- autocompletion for file opening
- history for prompts
- investigate sam's command language
- mouse scrollwheel
- tabs
- home goes to first non-whitespace character, if it's already there it goes to the first character of the line
- double click on resize handle / label hides all other editors of the column
- middle click on resize handle / label closes editor
- command to reload buffer contents from disk
- auto-reloading buffers when there is no change and the file on disk was changed
- reimplement hbox/vbox to not be broken on resize
  - column_adjust_size just takes the last row and uses all the empty space or 40% if there isn't any empty space
  - put the columns_hbox insite a single custom container that returns a requested size of { 0, 0 } and on allocation just resizes everything maintaining proportions

- word selection is longest sequence around point consisting of:
  - letters
  - numbers
  - [-_/]
  - if has at least one / treat as filename
  - if after the end a colon is found treat as filename
  - stuff after filename is optionally enclosed in [] and separed by either ":" or "," at most two numbers

- tcl commands to disable:
  - pwd <- return working directory for current buffer
  - unknown <- if it's a command in the path execute it as if it was specified in exec (but also expand all the words containing a * or a ?)
  
- tcl commands to add:
  - putm -> write into a message box
  - pwf -> return current buffer's file
  - kill -> kill's current process (if one is active in the buffer), otherwise kills current buffer. If an argument is specified does the same thing as the kill command
