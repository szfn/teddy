- Save cursor position on tied sessions
- set EDITOR, VISUAL to something reasonable in the default configuration (test perldoc perlfunc)
- possibility to restore a session directly from command line
- show session information on session load "menu"
- cd command should open new current directory

- make lexy a flat table, lexyassoc just gives the starting state but we can move to other states (implement mixed html / javascript mode)
- multiprocess highlighting
- tabs
- macro recording

- BUG: changing font after intialization results in trash (stuff in glyph_info isn't reloaded)
