- export teddy::open into the global namespace, do not touch existing files (end at first whitespace by default)
- handcoded matchers for identifiers and numbers
- optimize code that changes mouse cursor into a hand over links (right now its linear in the size of the buffer)
- left-right click combo should always eval
- don't open current directory unless no arguments are given
- buffer_set_mark_at_cursor and buffer_unset_mark are rare, check for deletion
- tooltips for tag buttons
- add one tag button to +bg buffers to prevent reuse
- do not show input textbox for incremental search (just an overlay saying "Searching" and move selection while typing)
- possible code sharing between columns and column?
- bold matched text in autocompletions window and iopen window
- EDITOR and VISUAL setting (needs some IPC implementation)
- multiprocess highlighting
- tabs
- macro recording

TRE PROBLEMS

- \s matches newlines too when REG_NEWLINE is enabled, it shouldn't
- nothing works inside [], \t doesn't work, \x<number> doesn't work etx...
- match with ^ still tries to match anywhere in the string, then fails
