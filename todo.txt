- some way to do IPC
- EDITOR and VISUAL setting (needs some IPC implementation)

- hide command line when it's not focused (or just use a different text color)
- each non-alphanumeric symbol should count as a word?
- code folding

- command to iterate through all the tokens of some type (make a separate command or shoehorn inside s?)

- bold matched text in autocompletions window and iopen window
