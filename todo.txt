- BUG: search and replace doesn't center on cursor after the very first move (subsequent moves are ok)
- BUG: replacements during search and replace do not update the modified indicator
- BUG: replace 0x00 bytes from file and process input with something else
- BUG: teddy called with a single directory as an argument doesn't start
- BUG: golang has `` for multiline strings
- BUG: bindent extends the selection line by line until it encounters an empty line
- mechanism to input last command sent to a job (bind it to ctrl-p)
- alias Ctrl-d to Del key in default configuration

- save buffer main font too
- optimize code that changes mouse cursor into a hand over links (right now its linear in the size of the buffer)
- bold matched text in autocompletions window and iopen window
- EDITOR and VISUAL setting (needs some IPC implementation)
- tabs
- macro recording

TRE PROBLEMS

- \s matches newlines too when REG_NEWLINE is enabled, it shouldn't
- nothing works inside [], \t doesn't work, \x<number> doesn't work etc...
- match with ^ still tries to match anywhere in the string, then fails
