GAP BUFFER

- reset undo info after load_text_file
- cursor interpretation should be changed (along with movegap), 0 is before the first character
- reimplement buffer_point_from_position
- reimplement buffer_move_point_line / buffer_move_point_glyph
- reimplement buffer_indent_newline
- reimplement parmatch_find
- reimplement interp_return_point_pair
- reimplement research
- reimplement lexy
- reimplement extend selection
- reimplement buffer_undo
- reimplement buffer_reload_glyph_info
- reimplement buffer_historycompl_word_at_cursor / buffer_wordcompl_word_at_cursor
- test saving
- implement m =<number> for absolute positioning by character number
- test selection from the very first character of the buffer (we need one extra empty character at the beginning of each file)
- test everything
- test sending input to processes
- reoptimize drawlines to skip glyphs outside
- reimplement posbox

OTHER

- lines -> gap buffer
- buffer_set_mark_at_cursor and buffer_unset_mark are rare, check for deletion

- possible code sharing between columns and column?
- bold matched text in autocompletions window and iopen window
- EDITOR and VISUAL setting (needs some IPC implementation)
- multiprocess highlighting
- tabs
- macro recording
