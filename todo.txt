- BUG: Ctrl-v inside a line doesn't work due to pasteq (deletes stuff)
- BUG: avrdude -> crash
- BUG: entering text doesn't center on cursor
- set column number for background processes whenever possible
- tabs
- macro recording
- make lexy a flat table, lexyassoc just gives the starting state but we can move to other states (implement mixed html / javascript mode)
- multiprocess highlighting
- buffers_close, buffers_close_all: don't take a window parameter and open error buffers when can continue with commands to eval to fix the problem

- document:
 s, c, m, ss, regexp, regsub, new buffer subcommands, tags, new bindent

- BUG: changing font after intialization results in trash (stuff in glyph_info isn't reloaded)
