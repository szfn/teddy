- minimal documentation

- paste full lines removes should equalize indentation
- implement | command that filters selected content through external command
- make easy way to reindent though external filter
- cmdcompl shoul build the list of internal commands dynamically
- implement man command that runs the man command in background and shows it in a new editor (must be possible to implement in tcl)
- command line autocompletion shouldn't include commands unless it's the first word con the command line
- opening directories
- command to refresh an open directory
- open current directory on startup
- implement command to create a scratch buffer
- fix mark words when used with cursor keys
- implement commands for macro editing
- implement stayoncmd flag for buffers
- implement lockcmd command that changes the command line of a buffer to always send a specific command
- implement disable horizontal scrollbar
- implement ability to switch a buffer's main font
- implement +bg+ buffer setup hook, set as defaults: stayoncmd, disable horzontal scrollbar, switch font to monospaced
- possible bug: selecting and scrolling doesn't work
- Ctrl-o move to next editor (keep a stack of editors like windows' windows)
- command to change buffer font to fixed width (start +bg buffers on fixed width by default)
- ansi sequences processing
- clear buffer command
- minimum size of an editor should be its tag alone, and there should be a simple way to minimize an editor
- 's' command: support normal pcre flags
- sort buffer menu by buffer name?
- appending to a buffer that was never displayed doesn't work (for some reason), tons of valgrind exceptions are generated. There is a valid use case for starting commands on an invisible buffer
- up/down arrows move through history
- persistence of history
- command to reload buffer contents from disk
- auto-reloading buffers when there is no change and the file on disk was changed
- tabs
- syntax highlighting
- left+middle -> cut
- move mouse cursor when searching
- configurability
  - enable/disable soft line wrap
- reimplement hbox/vbox to not be broken on resize
  - column_adjust_size just takes the last row and uses all the empty space or 40% if there isn't any empty space
  - put the columns_hbox insite a single custom container that returns a requested size of { 0, 0 } and on allocation just resizes everything maintaining proportions
- highlighting of matching parenthesis

- tcl commands to disable:
  - unknown <- if it's a command in the path execute it as if it was specified in exec (but also expand all the words containing a * or a ?)
  
- tcl commands to add:
  - kill -> kill's current process (if one is active in the buffer), otherwise kills current buffer. If an argument is specified does the same thing as the kill command
