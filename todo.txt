GAP BUFFER

- reimplement buffer_reload_glyph_info
- test sending input to processes
- reoptimize drawlines to skip glyphs outside the window
- optimize code that changes mouse cursor into a hand over links (right now its linear in the size of the buffer)
- remove buffer_next_glyph, it's only used in one place

OTHER

- simpler implementation of lexy (no regexp)
- better colors for the tag in all modes
- simplify acme color scheme
- don't open current directory unless no arguments are given
- buffer_set_mark_at_cursor and buffer_unset_mark are rare, check for deletion
- tooltips for tag buttons
- add one tag button to +bg buffers to prevent reuse
- do not show input textbox for incremental search (just an overlay saying "Searching" and move selection while typing)
- possible code sharing between columns and column?
- bold matched text in autocompletions window and iopen window
- EDITOR and VISUAL setting (needs some IPC implementation)
- multiprocess highlighting
- tabs
- macro recording

TRE PROBLEMS

- \s matches newlines too when REG_NEWLINE is enabled, it shouldn't
- nothing works inside [], \t doesn't work, \x<number> doesn't work etx...
- match with ^ still tries to match anywhere in the string, then fails
