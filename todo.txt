GAP BUFFER

- reimplement buffer_historycompl_word_at_cursor / buffer_wordcompl_word_at_cursor

- reimplement parmatch_find
- reimplement lexy
- reimplement buffer_reload_glyph_info
- reimplement posbox
- test sending input to processes
- reoptimize drawlines to skip glyphs outside
- optimize code that changes mouse cursor into a hand over links (right now its linear in the size of the buffer)

OTHER

- memory leaks?
- better colors for the tag in all modes
- don't open current directory unless no arguments are given
- buffer_set_mark_at_cursor and buffer_unset_mark are rare, check for deletion
- tooltips for tag buttons
- add one tag button to +bg buffers to prevent reuse
- do not show input textbox for incremental search (just an overlay saying "Searching" and move selection while typing)
- possible code sharing between columns and column?
- bold matched text in autocompletions window and iopen window
- EDITOR and VISUAL setting (needs some IPC implementation)
- multiprocess highlighting
- tabs
- macro recording
