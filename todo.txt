- BUG: music now segfaults

- annotate example.teddy and make sure all options are there

- cmdcompl should have only one critbit tree (discard it and remerge with path executables when changing directory)
- better shell command, remove pipe command (can be done with c and shell)
- non editable bg buffers, send typed text to job stdin
- dup buffer function?

- set column number for background processes whenever possible
- tabs
- guessing indentation (dtrt-indent mode1)
- auto-equalize indentation on paste
- macro recording
- some commands should be displayed on the working directory line (last command, two most used commands)
- move stuff to a namespace
- in buffers associated to jobs the cursor should be fixed at the end and inserting text should result in input to the job
- make lexy a flat table, lexyassoc just gives the starting state but we can move to other states (implement mixed html / javascript mode)
- multiprocess highlighting

- ability to persist the status of a window
- extend regular expressions in 's' to be lexically aware
- cleanup of unused functions (how?)
- all configuration options in the default configuration file with comments
- open in a directory view should be relative to the directory
- directories should be links too
- possibility to specify selection background exactly (instead of difference)

- document:
 s, c, m, ss, regexp, regsub, new buffer subcommands, tags

- BUG: changing font after intialization results in trash (stuff in glyph_info isn't reloaded)
