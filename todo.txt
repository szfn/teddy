- BUG: dragging tag doesn't work anymore

- m command: no colon on an argument implies :1 for mark and :$ for cursor, or :1 if only the cursor is specified

- BUG: minimized frames sometimes get stuck
- columns should resist changing size (ie the box should be dragged a bit more before they start resizing)

- bold matched text in autocompletions window and iopen window
- EDITOR and VISUAL setting (needs some IPC implementation)
- multiprocess highlighting
- tabs
- macro recording
