- ignore escape sequences on +bg+ buffers
- implement +bg+ buffer setup hook, set as defaults: stayoncmd, disable horzontal scrollbar, switch font to monospaced
- bug: character in gcc error output isn't found
- order file suggestions alphabetically
- order completion suggestion by increasing length (then by popularity)


- fix size reallocation on deleted editor
- comment region command
- refresh all buffers
- setpgid(<childpid>, 0) after forks
- splitting of columns, frames (instead of just adding at the end)
- replace tcl regex engine with TRE
- interface tabs
- TAGS files
- options for tab character visualization
- macros
- gdb integration
- fix bad rendering perfomance by killing cairo
- debugger integration (just displaying currently executed line)
- selection should copy selected text on past not on selection, for better efficiency (selection slowdown is noticeable on mouse selection)
- extend regular expressions in 's' to be lexically aware
- disable selection when another application becomes the owner of the primary selection buffer
- word movement, word selection and tokenization should be tied to syntax analysis
- change perror to show error windows
- implement | command that filters selected content through external command
- make easy way to reindent though external filter
- cmdcompl shoul build the list of internal commands dynamically
- command line autocompletion shouldn't include commands unless it's the first word con the command line
- implement command to create a scratch buffer
- fix mark words when used with cursor keys
- implement stayoncmd flag for buffers
- implement lockcmd command that changes the command line of a buffer to always send a specific command
- implement ability to switch a buffer's main font
- Ctrl-o move to next editor (keep a stack of editors like windows' windows)
- command to change buffer font to fixed width (start +bg buffers on fixed width by default)
- ansi sequences processing
- clear buffer command
- minimum size of an editor should be its tag alone, and there should be a simple way to minimize an editor
- 's' command: support normal pcre flags
- sort buffer menu by buffer name?
- appending to a buffer that was never displayed doesn't work (for some reason), tons of valgrind exceptions are generated. There is a valid use case for starting commands on an invisible buffer
- persistence of history
- ability to persist the status of a window
- auto-reloading buffers when there is no change and the file on disk was changed
- left+middle -> cut
- move mouse cursor when searching with mouse
- use an editor for the command line
- disabling soft word wrap
- clang syntax highlighting
- elastic tabs
