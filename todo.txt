- guessing indentation (dtrt-indent mode1)
 - if tabs and spaces are mixed on any line (ie there is a tab after the first space of the line) then give up
 - convert lines to a list of <number-of-tabs, number-of-spaces> pairs
 - calculate the maximum common divider of number-of-spaces
 - if it is 1 or 0 give up (intendation is tab based)
 - calculate max_spaces/MCD_spaces + 1 and convert any tab character to that number of tabs
 - convert any group of MCD_spaces to a tab
 - save parameters for reverting
- auto-equalize indentation on paste
- ability to persist the status of a window
- set column number for background processes whenever possible
- tabs
- macro recording
- make lexy a flat table, lexyassoc just gives the starting state but we can move to other states (implement mixed html / javascript mode)
- multiprocess highlighting

- document:
 s, c, m, ss, regexp, regsub, new buffer subcommands, tags

- BUG: changing font after intialization results in trash (stuff in glyph_info isn't reloaded)
