- make lexy a flat table, lexyassoc just gives the starting state but we can move to other states (implement mixed html / javascript mode)
- default keybinding to kill a bg buffer
- EDITOR and VISUAL setting (needs some IPC implementation)
- multiprocess highlighting
- tabs
- macro recording
- BUG: opening a directory twice opens a second empty directory frame and outputs the content of the directory to the first frame twice
- BUG: changing font after intialization results in trash (stuff in glyph_info isn't reloaded)
