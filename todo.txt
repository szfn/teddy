- center iopen on screen instead of centering it under the mouse
- rehash command to reload stuff in the path
- save buffer main font too
- optimize code that changes mouse cursor into a hand over links (right now its linear in the size of the buffer)
- left-right click combo should always eval
- bold matched text in autocompletions window and iopen window
- EDITOR and VISUAL setting (needs some IPC implementation)
- tabs
- macro recording

TRE PROBLEMS

- \s matches newlines too when REG_NEWLINE is enabled, it shouldn't
- nothing works inside [], \t doesn't work, \x<number> doesn't work etc...
- match with ^ still tries to match anywhere in the string, then fails
