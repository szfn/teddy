- undo (without redo)

- remove origin-dependent positioning of glyphs, glyph position should be absolute and scrolling should be done through the transformation matrix

- multiple columns
- ability to resize columns
- heuristics to autocreate new frames (and size them)
- drag and drop to rearrange frames
- note that the same buffer shall never appear in two different columns (otherwise the glyph positioning can not be unique)
  - other possibility: never show the same buffer twice: needs to change code to 'new', code to buffer manager and buffers_close (which calls editors_replace_buffer, which could cause two editors to have the same buffer)

- Ctrl-backspace to remove one word
- click on file name (inside tag) shows full path
- recalculation optimization (origin point is applyed through cairo with a translation matrix, call to buffer_line_adjust_glyphs is removed and buffer_adjust_glyphs is implemented that only readjusts lines that changed (this function is called once at the start of expose event)
- scripting (for keybindings)
- highlighting
- reminder: use menu key to highlight command line
- note: left button click does search/open, middle click does primary paste
- left+middle -> cut
- double click -> select word (and movement will also select words)
- triple click -> select lines (and movement will also select lines)
- modify origin repositioning to show cursor so that the cursor is put in the middle of the window
- autocompletion for file opening
- history for prompts
- investigate sam's command language
- mouse scrollwheel

- tcl commands to disable:
  - pwd <- return working directory for current buffer
  - unknown <- if it's a command in the path execute it as if it was specified in exec (but also expand all the words containing a * or a ?)
  
- tcl commands to add:
  - putm -> write into a message box
  - pwf -> return current buffer's file
  - kill -> kill's current process (if one is active in the buffer), otherwise kills current buffer. If an argument is specified does the same thing as the kill command
