- improve new frame heuristic
- better autocompletion: if nothing is selected in the completion menu complete with the longest common prefix
- splitting of columns instead of just adding at the end
- fix mouse region selection
- comment region command
- refresh all buffers
- replace tcl regex engine with TRE
- interface tabs
- TAGS files
- macros
- gdb integration
- debugger integration (just displaying currently executed line)
- selection should copy selected text on past not on selection, for better efficiency (selection slowdown is noticeable on mouse selection)
- extend regular expressions in 's' to be lexically aware
- disable selection when another application becomes the owner of the primary selection buffer
- word movement, word selection and tokenization should be tied to syntax analysis
- change perror to show error windows
- implement | command that filters selected content through external command
- make easy way to reindent though external filter
- cmdcompl shoul build the list of internal commands dynamically
- command line autocompletion shouldn't include commands unless it's the first word con the command line
- implement command to create a scratch buffer
- fix mark words when used with cursor keys
- implement stayoncmd flag for buffers
- implement lockcmd command that changes the command line of a buffer to always send a specific command
- Ctrl-o move to next editor (keep a stack of editors like windows' windows)
- 's' command: support normal pcre flags
- persistence of history
- ability to persist the status of a window
- auto-reloading buffers when there is no change and the file on disk was changed
- left+middle -> cut
- move mouse cursor when searching with mouse
- use an editor for the command line
- clang syntax highlighting
- elastic tabs
- resizing with reshandle will resize more editors if one isn't enough to bring the reshandle where it should be

new heuristic from acme:

* find the biggest window in activecol (bigw)
* find the window with the most empty space in activecol (emptyw)
* (both searches are biased towards the bottom of the column other things being equal)
* with el = empty space in emptyw:
  if (el > 15 || (el > 3 && (el > (size(bigw) -1)/2))) use emptyw
* if activecol == column of the current window, and the current window is at least 2/3 of size(bigw) replace bigw with the current window
* use bigw by splitting it by 2
