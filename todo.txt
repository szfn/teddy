- tag_drag_behaviour shouldn't ever close columns
- redo

- make lexy a flat table, lexyassoc just gives the starting state but we can move to other states (implement mixed html / javascript mode)
- multiprocess highlighting
- tabs
- macro recording

- BUG: changing font after intialization results in trash (stuff in glyph_info isn't reloaded)
