- BUG: change directory before focusing a buffer results in directory changed but new current directory isn't opened
- rotate history (it slows down startup)

- file highlighting relative to buffer's base directory
- open selected text *always* relative to buffer's base directory (just need to check, it could be already)
- eval command relative to buffer's base directory (like it was always prefixed with 'in')

- bold matched text in autocompletions window and iopen window
- EDITOR and VISUAL setting (needs some IPC implementation)
- tabs
- macro recording
