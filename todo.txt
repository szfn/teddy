- implement right click search/go
- bug: jobs appending text to a buffer should explicitly trigger an editor redraw somehow
- heuristic should pick the column with the biggest ending frame
- trailing spaces should be cleared by default
- implement command to create a scratch buffer
- implement commands for macro editing
- implement search & replace
- implement stayoncmd flag for buffers
- implement lockcmd command that changes the command line of a buffer to always send a specific command
- implement disable horizontal scrollbar
- implement ability to switch a buffer's main font
- implement +bg+ buffer setup hook, set as defaults: stayoncmd, disable horzontal scrollbar, switch font to monospaced
- move builtin commands code from example.teddy into a tcl file and change Makefile and interp.c so it's compiled in and loaded automatically
- Ctrl-o move to next editor (keep a stack of editors like windows' windows)
- command to change buffer font to fixed width (start +bg buffers on fixed width by default)
- ansi sequences processing
- clear buffer command
- minimum size of an editor should be its tag alone, and there should be a simple way to minimize an editor
- command to indent selection/everything by fixed number of spaces/tabs
- implement | command that filters selected content through external command
- make easy way to reindent
- double click -> select word (and movement will also select words)
- triple click -> select lines (and movement will also select lines)
- scrolling during mouse selection must be made slower (possibly hook into the cursor redraw timer?)
- sort buffer menu by buffer name?
- appending to a buffer that was never displayed doesn't work (for some reason), tons of valgrind exceptions are generated. There is a valid use case for starting commands on an invisible buffer
- up/down arrows move through history
- persistence of history
- command to reload buffer contents from disk
- auto-reloading buffers when there is no change and the file on disk was changed
- tabs
- smart search: search for exact case match only if there is at least one upcase letter in the input
- highlighting
- left+middle -> cut
- configurability
  - enable/disable soft line wrap
- reimplement hbox/vbox to not be broken on resize
  - column_adjust_size just takes the last row and uses all the empty space or 40% if there isn't any empty space
  - put the columns_hbox insite a single custom container that returns a requested size of { 0, 0 } and on allocation just resizes everything maintaining proportions
- highlighting of matching parenthesis
- move mouse cursor when grabbing focus to an editor
- move mouse cursor when searching

- word selection for open action is longest sequence around point consisting of:
  - letters
  - numbers
  - [-_/.(),:[]]
- open action will first run a tcl implemented parser

- tcl commands to disable:
  - unknown <- if it's a command in the path execute it as if it was specified in exec (but also expand all the words containing a * or a ?)
  
- tcl commands to add:
  - kill -> kill's current process (if one is active in the buffer), otherwise kills current buffer. If an argument is specified does the same thing as the kill command
