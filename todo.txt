- some way to do IPC
- bugfix: extend temporary highlighting past the end of the current frame
- bugfix: a job attaching to a frame should make sure the frame is not minimized

- command to iterate through all the tokens of some type (make a separate command or shoehorn inside s?)

- bold matched text in autocompletions window and iopen window
- EDITOR and VISUAL setting (needs some IPC implementation)
- tabs
- macro recording
